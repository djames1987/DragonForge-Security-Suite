  <strong>Security-first. Local-first. Zero-knowledge sync. Post-quantum-aware device trust.</strong>
</p>

DragonForge Password Manager is a Rust-based password manager built around a simple principle: **the systems that store or transport encrypted vault data should not need the secrets required to decrypt it**.

The project combines a hardened local encrypted vault, a native desktop application, Chrome/Edge browser integration, zero-knowledge multi-device synchronization, ML-DSA device identities, explicit device approval and revocation, offline disaster recovery, PostgreSQL-backed sync persistence, and Windows Credential Manager protection for local synchronization credentials.

> **Project status:** active development through Phase 11. Phase 11 Windows Credential Manager hardening has passed the full Windows automated verification suite, including optimized release tests, release binary builds, the RustSec applicability guard, and cargo-audit under the documented advisory policy.
>
> **Security notice:** DragonForge has not undergone an independent cryptographic or application-security audit. It should not yet be used for production credentials or other high-value secrets.

## What DragonForge is designed to do

DragonForge is more than an encrypted password file. It is being developed as a complete password-management system with distinct security boundaries:

| Area | Current capability |
|---|---|
| Local vault | Encrypted logins and secure notes with per-item keys |
| Unlock | Master password **plus** external 256-bit Account Secret |
| Desktop | Native Tauri 2 app backed by Rust |
| Browser | Chrome and Edge Manifest V3 extension with explicit fill |
| Sync | Zero-knowledge encrypted-vault synchronization |
| Conflicts | Explicit Keep Local / Keep Remote resolution |
| Device trust | ML-DSA-65 identities with approval and revocation |
| Recovery | Offline recovery kit with credential and device rotation |
| Server storage | In-memory development store or PostgreSQL |
| Windows secret storage | Credential Manager for sync token and device signing seed |
| Post-quantum layer | ML-KEM-768 and ML-DSA-65 primitives plus hybrid X25519 + ML-KEM |
| Verification | Unit, integration, adversarial, regression, release and CI testing |

# 1. A local encrypted vault that keeps useful data encrypted

DragonForge stores vault items in a versioned `.dfvault` file. Sensitive fields remain inside authenticated ciphertext.

Examples of encrypted item content include:

- item title;
- username;
- password;
- URL;
- notes;
- tags;
- favorite flag;
- item-specific login or secure-note data.

Structural metadata such as vault identifiers, record identifiers, revisions, timestamps and ciphertext sizes necessarily remain visible to the file parser.

### Example login record — user view

```text
Name:       Example Bank
Username:   david@example.com
Password:   ••••••••••••••••
URL:        https://bank.example
Tags:       finance, personal
Favorite:   yes
Notes:      Primary checking account
```

### What the vault file stores instead

```text
Vault ID
  ├── KDF parameters + salt
  ├── wrapped Vault Master Key
  └── encrypted item record
       ├── opaque item UUID
       ├── revision
       ├── timestamps
       ├── wrapped random item key
       └── AES-256-GCM encrypted payload
             └── title / username / password / URL / notes / tags / favorite
```

Search happens locally after unlock by decrypting records on the trusted desktop. DragonForge does not create a plaintext searchable index for the sync server.

---

# 2. Multi-factor vault unlock without putting both factors in the vault

DragonForge's current local vault unlock model uses both:

1. the user's **master password**; and
2. an external random **256-bit Account Secret**.

The Account Secret is generated when the vault is created and is deliberately not serialized inside the `.dfvault` file.

### Unlock construction

```text
Master Password
      │
      │ Argon2id
      ▼
Password Key
      │
      │ HKDF-SHA-512
      │ salt = Account Secret
      ▼
Unlock Key
      │
      └── AES-256-GCM unwraps random Vault Master Key
```

This means possession of the vault file alone is not intended to provide every input required for unlock.

The project currently defaults to Argon2id parameters of 64 MiB memory, 3 iterations and 1 lane, with a fresh 32-byte salt. Defensive parser limits prevent attacker-controlled vault files from freely selecting unbounded Argon2 parameters.

---

# 3. Per-item encryption instead of one giant plaintext object

DragonForge generates a random 256-bit Vault Master Key when a vault is created.

That VMK derives an item-wrap key using HKDF-SHA-512. Each item then receives its own fresh random 256-bit item key.

```text
Vault Master Key
      │
      │ HKDF-SHA-512
      ▼
Item-Wrap Key
      │
      ├── wraps Item Key A → encrypts Login A
      ├── wraps Item Key B → encrypts Secure Note B
      └── wraps Item Key C → encrypts Login C
```

Updates generate a fresh item key and fresh AES-GCM nonce before replacing an encrypted record.

Authenticated data binds encrypted content to the vault ID, item ID and record revision, helping make ciphertext substitution and revision tampering fail authentication.

---

# 4. Native desktop experience

DragonForge includes a Tauri 2 desktop application backed by the Rust vault engine.

Current desktop capabilities include:

- create a vault;
- unlock an existing vault;
- lock and scrub the active session;
- native file selection;
- add, edit and delete login items;
- create secure notes;
- local search;
- favorites;
- password generation;
- reveal/copy controls;
- encrypted backup export;
- full-vault integrity verification;
- master-password changes;
- synchronization controls;
- device management;
- recovery-kit creation;
- disaster recovery.

### Conceptual desktop layout

└──────────────────┴──────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────┘
```

The unlocked `Vault` object and Vault Master Key remain owned by the Rust process rather than JavaScript frontend state.

Credential-bearing Tauri command inputs are zeroized after use where practical, and locking drops the Rust session and scrubs decrypted UI state.

---

# 5. Browser filling without giving the extension the whole vault

DragonForge includes a Chromium Manifest V3 extension for **Google Chrome** and **Microsoft Edge**.

The extension is intentionally narrow:

- no broad host permissions;
- no persistent content script;
- no automatic submission;
- search returns only site-matching summaries;
- the password is requested only when the user explicitly chooses **Fill**;
- the desktop re-checks the destination host before releasing the selected credential.

### Browser fill example

Suppose the active tab is:

```text
https://accounts.example.com/login
```

The extension may show:

```text
DragonForge
────────────────────────────
Example Account
david@example.com

[ Fill ]
```

The search response does **not** need to contain the password.

Only after the user presses **Fill** does the native-host/desktop path request the selected credential. DragonForge performs a second host comparison before releasing it, then injects a one-shot script to populate visible login fields.

It does not automatically click the website's submit button.

### Browser security boundary

```text
Chrome / Edge extension
        │
        │ native messaging
        ▼
DragonForge native host
        │
        │ authenticated loopback bridge
        ▼
Running DragonForge desktop
        │
        ├── checks active site
        ├── reads unlocked vault
        └── returns only requested login
```

The master password, Account Secret, VMK and item-wrap key are not sent to the browser extension.

---

# 6. Zero-knowledge synchronization

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/product-overview/architecture.svg" alt="DragonForge zero-knowledge architecture" width="100%">
</p>

DragonForge synchronizes the **already-encrypted vault file** rather than sending decrypted records to the server.

The server stores opaque encrypted bytes and synchronization metadata needed for conflict detection and authorization.

### Server-side data

The sync service may hold:

- account UUID;
- SHA-256 digest of the sync bearer token;
- vault UUID;
- encrypted vault bytes;
- revision;
- SHA-256 ciphertext fingerprint;
- timestamps;
- device UUID/name/status;
- device ML-DSA verifying keys;
- encrypted recovery envelope;
- recovery ML-DSA verifying key;
- recovery generation.

### Data intentionally kept away from the sync server

| Secret / plaintext | Sync server needs it? |
|---|---:|
| Master password | **No** |
| Plaintext Account Secret | **No** |
| Vault Master Key | **No** |
| Item encryption keys | **No** |
| Login usernames/passwords | **No** |
| Secure-note plaintext | **No** |
| Private ML-DSA device seed | **No** |
| Private recovery seed | **No** |

The server can therefore coordinate encrypted state without being designed as a decryption authority.

---

# 7. Conflict-aware multi-device synchronization

DragonForge does not blindly choose the newest-looking file.

Each synchronized local vault tracks:

1. the current local encrypted-vault SHA-256;
2. the last synchronized encrypted-vault SHA-256;
3. the current server revision/hash.

That allows the client to distinguish:

- **up to date**;
- **local changed** → upload;
- **remote changed** → download;
- **both changed** → conflict;
- suspicious rollback;
- same-revision ciphertext mismatch;
- previously synchronized remote vault unexpectedly missing.

### Example: safe conflict handling

Device A and Device B both know server revision 7.

```text
Device A changes a login
    ↓
uploads base revision 7
    ↓
server stores revision 8

Device B also changed locally
    ↓
sees remote revision 8
    ↓
DragonForge reports a conflict
```

DragonForge then requires an explicit choice:

```text
[ Keep Local ]     [ Keep Remote ]
```

It does not silently merge or overwrite the user's encrypted vault.

For a remote pull, the incoming snapshot must pass hash validation, vault structural validation, vault-ID validation and authenticated encrypted-item validation before replacing the local encrypted file.

---

# 8. Device enrollment, approval and revocation

Synchronization is not protected only by possession of the bearer token.

Each synchronized desktop has an **ML-DSA-65 device identity**:

- random device UUID;
- human-readable name;
- local private signing seed;
- server-side verifying key;
- server status: `pending`, `active` or `revoked`.

### First device

The first device ever enrolled for an account becomes active and establishes the initial device trust graph.

### Additional device

A second device enters the pending state:

```text
New Laptop
Status: pending
```

An already-active device must explicitly approve it.

### Signed synchronization

After device enrollment exists, vault requests require:

- bearer sync token;
- device UUID;
- request timestamp;
- ML-DSA signature.

The signed request transcript binds:

- HTTP method;
- API path;
- timestamp;
- SHA-256 of the body;
- base revision when relevant.

Requests more than five minutes outside server time are rejected.

### Revocation example

```text
Primary Desktop     active
Family Laptop       active
Old Laptop          revoked
```

A revoked device is denied synchronization even if it still has an old copy of the bearer token.

Revocation is terminal in the storage layer: a stale approval cannot transition a revoked identity back to active.

---

# 9. Secure lost-device recovery

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/product-overview/recovery-flow.svg" alt="DragonForge lost-device recovery flow" width="100%">
</p>

Phase 10 solves the case where **every trusted synchronized device is lost**.

DragonForge creates a dedicated offline ML-DSA recovery identity. The private seed is placed in a user-held recovery kit:

```text
DFRK1:<account-id>:<vault-id>:<generation>:<ml-dsa-seed-hex>
```

The server receives only the corresponding verifying key.

The Account Secret is encrypted client-side using a key derived from the recovery seed and vault identity. The server stores the resulting encrypted recovery envelope, not the plaintext Account Secret.

### Recovery workflow example

A replacement computer is given:

```text
Destination:          C:\Vaults\recovered.dfvault
Sync server:          https://sync.example.com
Recovery kit:         DFRK1:...
Master password:      ***************
Replacement device:  New Desktop
```

DragonForge then:

1. signs a recovery-begin request;
2. retrieves the encrypted Account Secret envelope;
3. decrypts the Account Secret locally;
4. retrieves the opaque encrypted vault;
5. verifies its hash, structure and vault ID;
6. tries the supplied master password locally;
7. only after local unlock succeeds, completes server-side recovery.

Successful completion atomically:

- revokes previous devices;
- creates a fresh replacement-device identity;
- rotates the sync token;
- rotates the recovery key;
- increments the recovery generation.

A wrong master password does **not** consume the current recovery kit or modify server trust.

---

# 10. Windows Credential Manager protection

Phase 11 moves the remaining synchronization secrets out of the sidecar on Windows.

Before Phase 11, the sync sidecar contained:

```json
{
  "syncToken": "<256-bit bearer token>",
  "deviceSigningSeedHex": "<private ML-DSA seed>"
}
```

On Windows, the current version-3 sidecar instead contains a random credential reference:

```json
{
  "version": 3,
  "serverUrl": "https://sync.example.com",
  "lastRevision": 12,
  "lastContentSha256": "...",
  "deviceId": "...",
  "deviceName": "Primary Desktop",
  "credentialId": "..."
}
```

The sync token and ML-DSA device seed are stored in **Windows Credential Manager**.

Legacy Phase 8/9/10 sidecars migrate automatically. Migration is designed to fail closed if Credential Manager cannot accept the secret.

The desktop reports the current secret-storage mode:

```text
Sync configured
https://sync.example.com · revision 12 · secrets: Windows Credential Manager
```

Linux/macOS currently retain the legacy sidecar mechanism and are explicitly reported as such rather than being described as OS-protected.

---

# 11. Defense in depth

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/product-overview/security-layers.svg" alt="DragonForge layered security model" width="100%">
</p>

DragonForge deliberately uses multiple security boundaries instead of treating one encryption key as the entire security model.

### Layer A — password hardening

Argon2id derives a password key using bounded, validated parameters.

### Layer B — external Account Secret

HKDF-SHA-512 combines the password-derived key with a separately stored random 256-bit Account Secret.

### Layer C — random VMK

The unlock key wraps a random 256-bit Vault Master Key.

### Layer D — per-item keys

A derived item-wrap key protects fresh random keys for each individual vault item.

### Layer E — authenticated record context

AES-256-GCM authenticates ciphertext together with vault/item/revision context.

### Layer F — device authorization

ML-DSA-65 device identities sign enrollment decisions and synchronization requests.

### Layer G — offline recovery

A separate recovery identity can replace trust after total device loss without giving the sync server the recovery private seed.

### Layer H — Windows OS credential storage

The bearer sync token and private device signing seed are moved out of copied sidecar files.

---

# 12. Cryptographic building blocks

DragonForge currently uses:

| Primitive | Role |
|---|---|
| Argon2id | Master-password key derivation |
| AES-256-GCM | Authenticated vault/item/envelope encryption |
| HKDF-SHA-512 | Domain-separated key derivation and secret combining |
| SHA-256 | Ciphertext fingerprints and token digests |
| ML-KEM-768 | Post-quantum KEM layer |
| ML-DSA-65 | Device and recovery signatures |
| X25519 | Classical half of the hybrid key-establishment construction |
| OS CSPRNG | Nonces, keys, tokens, IDs and secret material |

The post-quantum primitives use the pure-Rust RustCrypto `ml-kem` and `ml-dsa` crates.

DragonForge also implements an application-level **X25519 + ML-KEM-768** hybrid construction for future protocols. It is not claimed to be the TLS 1.3 X25519MLKEM768 wire format.

---

# 13. Hardened vault parser and storage behavior

The vault parser validates structure before performing expensive password derivation.

Current defensive limits include:

- maximum vault file: **64 MiB**;
- maximum items: **100,000**;
- maximum encrypted item payload: **1 MiB**;
- Argon2 memory cap: **1 GiB**;
- Argon2 iteration cap: **20**;
- Argon2 lane cap: **16**;
- KDF salt bounds;
- exact wrapped-key ciphertext shape;
- supported envelope versions;
- valid/unique UUIDs;
- non-zero record revisions;
- timestamp ordering.

Vault saves use same-directory temporary files, synchronization, backup renames and recovery logic.

If the live file is missing and a last complete backup exists, DragonForge can restore that backup before reading. An orphan temporary file alone is never automatically promoted to the live vault.

---

# 14. Encrypted backup and master-password changes

### Backup

Backup export writes the already-encrypted vault representation to a new file.

Backup import:

1. opens the source with the provided master password and Account Secret;
2. performs full item integrity verification;
3. refuses to overwrite an existing destination;
4. writes the encrypted representation only after validation succeeds.

The Account Secret is intentionally not embedded into the backup.

### Master-password change

Changing the master password creates a new Argon2id salt and derives a new unlock key.

DragonForge rewraps the VMK; it does not need to decrypt and re-encrypt every item solely because the master password changed.

---

# 15. Sync server deployment choices

The sync server is a separate Rust application.

### Development

For deterministic local testing it can run with volatile in-memory storage:

```powershell
$env:DRAGONFORGE_SYNC_ADMIN_TOKEN = "<32+ byte development token>"
cargo run -p dragonforge-sync-server
```

Default development bind:

```text
127.0.0.1:8787
```

### Persistent server

With the PostgreSQL feature enabled:

```powershell
$env:DRAGONFORGE_SYNC_DATABASE_URL = "postgres://user:password@127.0.0.1/dragonforge"
cargo run -p dragonforge-sync-server --features postgres
```

Checked-in migrations create storage for:

- sync accounts;
- encrypted vault snapshots;
- device enrollment records;
- recovery records.

Remote deployment requires HTTPS/TLS termination. Plain HTTP is accepted by the desktop only for loopback development addresses such as `127.0.0.1`, `localhost` and `::1`.

---

# 16. Example end-to-end user journey

A realistic DragonForge workflow looks like this:

### Day 1 — create the vault

```text
Create Vault
   ↓
Choose master password
   ↓
DragonForge generates Account Secret
   ↓
Save Account Secret separately
   ↓
Add logins + secure notes
```

### Day 2 — connect browser fill

```text
Install unpacked Chrome/Edge extension
   ↓
Register DragonForge native messaging host
   ↓
Unlock DragonForge desktop
   ↓
Visit matching website
   ↓
Select saved login
   ↓
Explicit Fill
```

### Day 3 — enable sync

```text
Start/provision sync server
   ↓
Configure sync token
   ↓
Enroll Primary Desktop
   ↓
Initial encrypted vault upload
```

### Day 4 — add a second computer

```text
Configure second device
   ↓
New device = pending
   ↓
Approve from active desktop
   ↓
Second device becomes active
   ↓
Encrypted state synchronizes
```

### Disaster scenario

```text
All devices lost
   ↓
Install DragonForge on replacement PC
   ↓
Provide offline DFRK1 recovery kit
   ↓
Provide master password
   ↓
Recover encrypted vault
   ↓
Old devices revoked
   ↓
Sync token rotated
   ↓
New recovery kit generated
```

---

# 17. Verification strategy

DragonForge's development process has accumulated regression coverage instead of replacing old tests whenever a new phase is added.

Current automated coverage includes areas such as:

- Argon2 parameter rejection;
- AES-GCM round trips and tamper rejection;
- HKDF domain separation;
- constant-time comparison behavior;
- ML-KEM-768 encapsulation/decapsulation;
- ML-DSA-65 signing and tamper rejection;
- hybrid X25519 + ML-KEM behavior;
- vault creation/unlock/reload;
- plaintext leakage checks;
- wrong-password and wrong-Account-Secret rejection;
- update/delete/search;
- encrypted backup/import;
- adversarial vault mutation;
- medium-vault stress;
- browser-origin validation;
- browser search/fill scoping;
- sync revision conflicts;
- remote snapshot tamper rejection;
- multi-device conflict resolution;
- device enrollment and proof-of-possession;
- pending/revoked device denial;
- recovery rotation;
- wrong-master recovery preservation;
- PostgreSQL feature coverage;
- Windows Credential Manager integration for Phase 11.

Windows verification runners create a log plus SHA-256 checksum so test evidence can be retained and reviewed independently from console output.

# 19. Current boundaries and honest limitations

DragonForge is intentionally documented with its limitations.

Notable items not yet provided include:

- independent security audit;
- Windows Hello user-presence enforcement;
- TPM-bound non-exportable device private keys;
- macOS Keychain support;
- Linux Secret Service support;
- hardware security-key recovery;
- mobile client/recovery UI;
- social or multi-party recovery;
- signed append-only rollback history;
- automatic field-level conflict merging.

The current Windows Credential Manager hardening protects secrets at rest from simple copied-sidecar attacks, but it does not claim to protect a fully compromised logged-in Windows session from same-user malware.

## Product identity in one sentence

> **DragonForge Password Manager is a Rust-native, local-first password manager that combines a hardened encrypted vault with zero-knowledge synchronization, post-quantum-aware device trust, explicit browser filling, recoverable multi-device security and OS-backed protection of local sync credentials.**

The goal is not simply to encrypt passwords. It is to build a system in which **vault encryption, device authorization, synchronization, browser access and recovery each have separate, inspectable security boundaries**.
